 The Diskjstra algo appears to work ok. Tested with 16 nodes with correct results (Distances and Path)
 The rendering appears ok too.
 Started to have some randering in color of the path (Diskstras)

 To Do:
   Need to continue on the draw path (from a start node to an end node) in a color
   Draw node colors based on the distance of a source node? (Closer in green and futher in red)

  Many Javascript classes/file to typescript(Index.ts, the Model and View classes)
  Fixed the custome rendering and it works
  Started to have the index.html look like the one in the js-graph-analysis\graph-dsf-weight project

  The Search All paths! doesn't appear to work


To Do: 
  Work on the Diskjstra algo
  Continue to work on the  index.html (to be like the js-graph-analysis\graph-dsf-weight)

  Restore the BellmanFord code

Worked on the Typescript problems, and had a solution (not pretty dough), where all the typescript code can
be used and seen in the browser

Will resume the study of graph using Typescript from now on...

To Do:
  Need to pull the latest progress from the js-graph-analysis\graph-dsf-weight project (as it is the most advanced of my projects)
  Diskjtra and Custom render are the top priority to include into this Typescript project

  Started the conversion to Typescript, but the inclusion the the transpiled javascript is
  causing a lot of problems...
  
  
  
  Few work around in progress, and are very promising:
  
  1 - Need to have a tsconfig.json
  
    This appears to be good for now
      {
          "compilerOptions": {
            "allowJs": true,            
            "checkJs": true,
            "outDir": "dist",
            "sourceMap": true,
            "target": "ES6",
            "noImplicitAny": true,
            "noImplicitReturns": true,
            "strict": true
          }
  }
    
  2 - No more import {...} in the HTML file, or even any Javascript calls!
      Just put the <script src="yourScript.js"> and make all the calls in the .js file

  3 - Fix the 'ReferenceError: exports is not defined' error
  
  In the browser, an error happens at runtime, and the second line of the transpiled ts file
  is causing problem.
  
  the 'exports' variable may not be defined for some reason, add the following script tag:
  
  <script>var exports = {};</script> 
  <script src="index.js"></script>   // This one is your file you did transpile to javascript
